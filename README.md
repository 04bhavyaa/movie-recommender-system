## Movie Recommendation System

* We need to create a content based recommendation system. (We'll create tags. So not keeping numerical columns for now.)
* Let's remove unnecessary columns.
* For this we'll analyze if a column will be helpful to create tags for movies or not.
* Using right now: genres, id, keywords, title, overview, cast, crew
* Removing all other!
* future enhancements: release_date, revenue, spoken_languages, vote_average, vote_count
